ExtAngular
 - use ExtJS 6.7
 - modern kitchensink
 - modern Sencha Tests
 - modern docs
 - ext-angular-gen
 - package ext-angular.service
 - clean up bootstrapping process
 - ExtAngular functionality
   - using *ngIf (etc) in an ExtAngular component
   - conflict with button class
 - plugin tree-shaking (for ExtJS ext.js and ext.css)
 - tree shake the typescript ExtAngular files
 - clean doxi output
 - use type info for properties in ts ExtAngular files


Issues
 - (major) render method does not parse the HTML code but uses as string [See multiple grid examples] [isolate to standalone angular app]  
 - (major) widgetcell tag not working. (And plugins for that matter) [Eg. Big Data & Render Cell in components] [Visit RendererCell like in react/ Need a simple example in extjs]
 - (major) orgchart component does not exists (Under pivot/hierearchy) [External component addition].  
 - (major) ExtAngular components that use Angular structural directives (e.g. ngFor, ngIf) do not dynamically update when their bound data changes.  This is preventing the following from working as desired - Code Preview (you muist reload the page to see the correct code preview panels).
 - UI for SearchField is breaking. Search form is not docked right. (Form fields - Eg( All>Components>Forms>Searchfield or ALl->Components>TitleBar)
 - we need to specify size in root element of each example else it does not show up. This will break on different screen sizes. [Add examples]
 - DragResizeValidation calendar example does not restrict dragging and resizing 
 - resources from packages like ux are not property referenced [Componenrs -> Color Picker -> Basic]



Issues (faced by Alisha) in api-docs examples: 
- selectfield not working for CellEditing and editable grid plugins.
- In RowExapander.js example, row expanding not working.


Fixed
 - TouchEvents: Events list is not updated (using *ngFor rendering)
 - In Drag Drop text does not change when draging. (check Proxy and Handles). Files Drag Drop not working for same reason as UI is not updated. 
 - ResizableHandle in Panels:Unable to resize the panel from corners and dynamic option not working 
 - ResizableLayoutComponent have multiple UI issues. (to reproduce compare from ext-react). Can demo this in next call. 
 - Hierarchy D3: In ZoomableSunburst selectionChange() used in react but unable to find an equivalent here.
  so zooming not working on selection of chart node.
 - FAB button is not positioned properly.
 - CSS for syntax highlighting is hard coded in index.html because it wasn't loading when specified in the component's styleUrls. - see ext-angular-demo
 - (major) Tabs: All components are not rendering. Error: Adding a card to a tab container without specifying any tab configuration
 - (major) Tree widgets not loading with error ERROR Error: [Ext.create] Unrecognized class name / alias: widget.tree [Need to revisit D3 tree] 
  - (major) Tree widgets not loading with error ERROR Error: [Ext.create] Unrecognized class name / alias: widget.tree [Fixed/Need to revisit D3 tree] 
  - [Aniket] Button and split button menu always shows up ([hidden] attribute does not work as well as *ngif). [use setMenu method/zip and project to Marc] - Done/Revisit angular way (Low priority)
